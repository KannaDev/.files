A recreation of a debian rice that i found on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/108amd2/i3gaps_eimiko_on_lesbian_debian_linux/). 
This was setup, tested and ran on PopOS, it may run on other Debian Based Distros, though it will require some modifying of the script. 
As we do not suggest running it on Distro's it has not been tested on, we do not provide any documentation on how to do so at this time.
